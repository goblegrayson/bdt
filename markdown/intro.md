After reading Emanuel Derman's fantastic [biography](https://emanuelderman.com/books/my-life-as-a-quant/), I wanted to learn about the single factor short-rate model he developed with Fischer Black and Bill Toy.
This Python implementation is based on [the original 1990 paper](http://marshallinside.usc.edu/dietrich/FAJ-1990-BlackDermanToy-OneFactor.pdf)
and intended to build intuition with the model and binomial tree models in general.

More writeup coming soon!
